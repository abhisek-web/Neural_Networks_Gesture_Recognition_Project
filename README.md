We created a model that will recognise five different gestures performed by the user further helping users control the TV without using a remote.
In this project, you will build a model to recognise 5 hand gestures.

**Project Pipeline:**

  1. Generator: The generator was able to take a batch of videos as input without any error. Steps like cropping, resizing and normalization are performed successfully.
  
  2. Model: Developed a model that is able to train without any errors which will be judged on the total number of parameters and the accuracy achieved.
